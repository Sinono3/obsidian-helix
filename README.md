# Obsidian Helix Keybindings

This plugin enables [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) keybindings in [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) using the [Helix CodeMirror6 extension by jrvidal](https://gitlab.com/_rvidal/codemirror-helix).
This plugin simply adds the extension to the editor, all credit goes to [jrvidal](https://github.com/jrvidal) for actually implementing the extension.

Keep in mind the CM6 extension is in a very early stage of development.

## Installation

Because this plugin isn't oficially in the Obsidian plugin list (yet), you must install it directly from the repo.
Two ways to do this are using BRAT or manually.

### Via BRAT

1. [Install BRAT](https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=brat)
2. Copy the link to this Git repository
3. Follow [these instructions](https://tfthacker.com/brat-quick-guide#Adding+a+beta+plugin)

### Manually

1. Clone the repository into `<your vault directory>/.obsidian/plugins` and then run:
  ```
  $ npm i
  $ npm run build
  ```
2. Go to Settings in Obsidian and enable `Helix Keybindings`.

## Usage

1) Make sure Vim keybindings are disabled in `Options->Editor->Advanced`.
2) Enable Helix keybindings in the plugin settings or toggle them via the command.
